# VideoScreensaver

A simple Windows Screensaver based on LibVLC and WinForms with multimonitor support. (Probably will look into alternatives since bundling VLC with a Screensaver is pretty overkill)

# Features
-  Multi-monitor support
-  Wide format support (Even images/audio)

# Requirements
- A Windows based system with [.NET Framework 4.7.2 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472)

# How to build/contribute
- The project is based in Visual Studio 2022 using .NET 4.7.2, WinForms and LibVLC libraries, just clone the repository upon opening Visual Studio. 

## Disclaimer
Although basic functionality is complete, the project is still pretty barebones and a lot of features are missing or incomplete.
